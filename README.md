## How to receive chat messages
To receive the Twitch chat messages, connect the `chat_message_received` signal from VerySimpleTwitch. The signal contains all the information available from the chatter, including display_name, badges, tags and colors.
```
func _ready():
	VerySimpleTwitch.chat_message_received.connect(print_chatter_msg)

func print_chatter_message(chatter: Chatter):
	print("Message received from %s: %s % [chatter.tags.display_name, escape_bbcode(chatter.message)])
```

## How to send chat messages
To send chat messages you can use the ``VerySimpleTwitch.send_chat_message("Hello world")`` static method. Sending chat messages is only available when you use OAuth connection method with a Token that has writting permissions.
